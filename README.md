Email spam filter: 
For our problem we can set S as the probability of the given email being spam, and C as the contents of the email, which are given to us in a bag of words model. For each email, if the conditional probability of an email being spam given the contents is greater than the conditional probability of it not being spam given the contents, we can classify the email as spam, otherwise we cannot.
